# Calorie-Tracker-
#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description: 
For my CS50P final project, I will be creating a Calorie Tracker. The Calorie Tracker will have two modes, one mode to add and one to track. The first mode, add, will ask the user the date, the time of day, which meal(Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack), and what foods the user ate. After inputing the data, the program will then write to an excel file which will orgranize the data. The other mode is track, which will read back your total calories for the day, if you set a goal, how many calories you can still eat, and if you are over or under the calorie goal.
